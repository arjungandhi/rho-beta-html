							Rho Beta Epsilon is a relatively newly established Honor Society for undergraduate and graduate Robotics Engineering (RBE) majors. This organization acts as a resource for the most passionate of RBE students, and aids them in both college and post-college career development. We strive to build connections and create events to enhance the RBE community. Rho Beta Epsilon is comprised of outstanding RBE students who have excelled in both general classes and robotics projects. The society contains both graduate and undergraduate students determined to build connections and hold events to enhance the Robotics Engineering community. Whatâ€™s more than that, however, is the fact that we all want to make each other feel as welcome as possible. We are building a group of engineers that will not only help each other be successful in their careers, both in and out of college, but also in their lives.

							<p>
							The founders of this website are the Alpha Chapter of Rho Beta Epsilon. The students of Alpha Chapter study RBE at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. Originally founded by seven determined undergraduates, Rho Beta Epsilon is quickly seeking new universities interested in expanding into RBE major options, or already providing degrees in Robotics. Worcester Polytechnic Institute boasts the first ever degrees offered in specifically RBE, and continues to grow as a program every single year, just newly expanding into our multimillion dollar Foisie Innovation Studio. We hope to continue growing and inspire other universities to answer the call to arms of robotics engineering everywhere, as we have.
